Definitions:
Polynomial: A polynomial is of the form
f(x) = anxn + an-1xn-1 + ... + a1x + a0 Eq(1)
Where n is the order of the polynomial.
Examples: f (x) = 2x2 - 4x + 10 (Order 2)
f (x) = 9 (Order 0)
In the following definitions, the “equation” can be a polynomial but also any other equation.
Parameters
The values of the constants in an equation. For example, [an, an-1, …a1, a0] are the parameters of an nth-order polynomial, [2, -4, 10] are the parameters of the 2nd order example above, and [C, t] are the parameters of the equation f(x) = C*exp(-x/t). When parameters are constants that multiply terms (such as “C” but not “t” in the last example), we also call them coefficients.
Curve fitting:
Fitting an equation to a set of data points. This is used to test how well a quantitative model fits the data. That is, if you have a data set (x,y), where x and y are vectors, then curve fitting is finding an equation f(x), so that f(x(i)) is close to y(i) for all indices i in the vectors.
Residual:
For each data point, its residual is the difference between the actual data point and the value of the equation used to model the data. That is, the residual is f(x(i)) –y(i).
Least squares fit:
The parameters of an equation that give the lowest value for the sum of the squares of all of the residuals. That is, the least squares fit finds the parameter values P that minimize the function sumerror = sum(f(P,x(i)) –y(i)), where f(P,x(i)) is the equation with parameters P calculated at the point x(i). For example, if the equation is a 2nd order polynomial and P is [2,-4,10], then f(P,x(i)) = 2(x(i))2 - 4x(i) + 10.Definitions:
